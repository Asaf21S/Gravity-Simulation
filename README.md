# Gravity Simulation
Computer Graphics Lab  
This simulation demonstrate the interaction between planetary bodies through gravitational forces. The user can create planets with different size, density and initial velocity, can edit each planet separately and control the gravitational constant. When the setup is ready, the user can then click on the Start button and the simulation will begin.  
The concept of gravity is shown here as a force of attraction between each pair of planets that the user created. Each different setup will produce different results which may include collisions or any kind of periodic revolutions such as 2 planets orbit around each other.
Some collisions make a big explosions and create several smaller planets/asteroids, while others, donâ€™t break things apart but leave impact craters. For instance, Mars has been shaped by impact. Its northern half is smooth and low, its southern half mountainous and rough.

  planet.move(velocity);

Compensate on last week's progress.  
Bug fix - when the velocity or acceleration vector became 0, their arrow stayed the same as before, instead of disappearing - about 15 minutes.  
On planets collision, if one of the planets is large and the other is small, the large planet will absorb the small planet - its radius and density will increase - about 45 minutes.

Which is pretty good but it doesn't look natural so I was trying to add shadows to the edge of the planet by multiplying the image:  
<img src="Media/planet.jpg" width="300" height="300" />  
But got into problems of using 2 textures for one planet.
