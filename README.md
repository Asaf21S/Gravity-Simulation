### <ins>27.2 - 5.3:</ins> (6 hours total)
Coming up with the general idea of the project and searching for the best fitting language and graphics library for it - about 1 hour.  
Studying the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) - about 4 hours.  
Setting up a Github repository and a Visual Studio project with a simple working demo window of the SFML - about 1 hour.  

### <ins>6.3 - 12.3:</ins> (10 hours and 30 minutes total)
Creating the Planet class which encapsulates everything that a planet have, and the PlanetSystem class which includes a planet vector and is responsible for the general settings of the simulation - about 2 hours.  
What I got so far:

Creating a Slider Class to use in menus - about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  
Creating a Button Class to use in menus - about 40 minutes.  
Handling the creation of planets by clicking on the screen - about 1 hour.  
Creating a CheckBox Class to use in menus - about 15 minutes.  
Menu Components:  
![ExampleOfMenu](Media/6-3-menuExample.png?raw=true)  
Shaping the menu area and disable the creation of a planet inside the menu - about 2 hours.  
Preventing planets from intersecting one another on creation - about 45 minutes.  
Centralized the menu items and bindind the gravitational constant with a slider - about 1 hour and 30 minutes.

### <ins>13.3 - 19.3:</ins> (5 hours total)
Creating the arrow from each planet which represent its velocity vector - about 3 hours.  
What I got so far:  
<img src="Media/14-3-velocityArrow.gif" width="576" height="324" />  
Adding support for the acceleration arrow as well, and adjusting the arrow dimensions to look good at any size - about 2 hours.  
Didn't make any more progress due to illness.  

### <ins>20.3 - 26.3:</ins> (? hours total)
Encapsulating the menu items in a Menu class in preperation for adding planet-specific menu, coming up with the solution on how the Menu class can communicate with the PlanetSystem class on menu item's event and implementing it - about 4 hours and 30 minutes  
Changing the menu items' classes to work more efficiently with the Menu class - about 3 hours.
